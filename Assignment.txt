Please do these after setting up (see October 22 Instructions)

1) go to http://nodeschool.io

2) go to terminal and type: 
	npm install -g git-it learnyounode

3) Try to finish all the tasks in learnyounode. You can copy code online.
	The solutions are online as well. I am not going to check
	any code. Just make sure you understand the core concepts.
	
	They are really made to be hard, so you may need to research
	a little bit. You may find the javascript documentation and 
	nodejs documentation handy. Ask for help if you need it
	or do not understand it. Don't try to finish it in one day.

	How to do learnyounode:
	type:
		learnyounode
	in the terminal and you will be prompted to a separate menu. From
	there, try to follow the directions. If tou need help, tell me.
	Try to use google and get acquainted with stackoverflow.

4) bonuses: try to not use any external libraries for learnyounode. Only
	use core modules (fs, http, ...)
