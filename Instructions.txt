Instructions:
	(Note "Please use one email for all these things")
	1) Create a GitHub account. (www.github.com)
	2) Create a FreedCamp account (www.freedcamp.com)
	3) Download and install Git (https://git-scm.com/)
	4) Install node and npm (https://nodejs.org/en/)
	5) Comment the email address you used, and your GitHub account 
		username. Please tell me the operating system you intend to 
		use so I can start making some scripts.

	>> I am going to add you as a contributor in GitHub so you can push
		into our repository.
	>> Freedcamp will be used to check our progress. We can discuss tasks
		when we meet. Once you have an assigned task, place it to the in-
		progress when you are working on it, and the completed column once
		finished. Please test your code so we won't have a hard time during
		integration.
	>> Github will be our VCS. We don't need to meet to have progress. But you do need
		to have some form of an internet connection.


	=== RULES ===
	1) DO NOT PUSH ASSETS into our github repository.
	 	Assets include but are not limited to:
	 	Images, audio files, icons, etc. These files are large and will
	 	make it inconvenient to push, pull, and commit. Transfer these large
	 	files via FB or USB flash drive instead so our workflow is faster.

	 	Pushing assets will also make our .git file unnecessarily large.

	2) Commit frequently, integrate frequently.
		Let us try to have a working system state every 24 hours. Do not push
		buggy code. Please test your code first.

	3) Document.
		Comment well! And be sure to make self-documenting commit messages.
		Especially in commit messages. Avoud vague statements like "fixed bug".
		Commit messages are useful whenever we want to track down commits that
		can break our system. Don't worry if you make a mistake in your commit
		message; we can check what you changed between commits anyway.

	4) There are exceptions to these rules. If you have to, you may ask.
